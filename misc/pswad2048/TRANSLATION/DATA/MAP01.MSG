7,"It's better that we stay together until we know the enemy's strength."
3,"...What, we have to fight again?"
5,"Even if it's just a bit faster or one more corpse left in my wake, I'll send you to oblivion!"
3,"Say the word and I'm ready for action."
4,"I can't get nervous now, can I..."
4,"Come at me, I'll take you four at a time!"
7,"Hiieee... There are Yoju all over the place..."
0,"..."
8,"Don't lose sight of your target!"
4,"How many Yoju ARE there?!"
6,"Let's bring this to an end now, I can't allow you to live for even a second longer!"
4,"I won't let you escape! Humans are the ones who will survive!"
5,"I've had enough training for this, I can do it!"
5,"We've decreased their numbers significantly, but don't pursue too far! Hold to the ranks!"
8,"Fu fu fu... Looks like it's MY turn now..."
0,"......"
9,"Surround the surviving enemy forces!"
5,"There's some left over even now..."
7,"I've got a bad feeling about this."
5,"It looks like they're all weaklings... We shouldn't have any trouble wiping them up."

6,"Sheesh... Where are they all pouring out from?"
9,"My uniform is all dirty!"
0,"..."
10,"Please check the fatigue levels of your units, sir."
6,"When will we be free of this?"
8,"I can still continue!"
6,"Don't underestimate us humans!"
7,"Shouldn't we withdraw the more fatigued troops?"
7,"At this rate I'll be able to fight with plenty of energy left to spare."
10,"Fuu, I'm hungry..."
0,"......"
11,"The disposal of all enemies is now only a matter of time."
7,"No matter how long we fight it just won't end..."
9,"We've taken care of most of them!"
7,"When this is finished we'll treat the wounded and prepare for the next round of battle..."
8,"I'm going to have to get used to this sort of battle plan, too..."
8,"Looking good!"
11,"Fuheeeee! Yoju corpses are everywhere!"
0,"........."
