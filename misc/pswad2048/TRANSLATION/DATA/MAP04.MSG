34,"It's a long road ahead! Make sure we don't use too much energy on this floor!"
28,"I don't want to fight any more..."
32,"The Yoju have no place to live upon this Earth!"
27,"Come on... I'll be your enemy."
25,"Does the fact that the Yoju are making tactical maneuvers mean they have a commander?"
27,"If they take the airport, Sofiapolis will be isolated."
29,"We'll get through this somehow..."
0,"..."
35,"We don't need to waste our time here."
29,"We biosoldiers are bearing the burden of humanity's misdeeds."
33,"Regret that you were born when you're in hell, if you have the wit!"
28,"I can't let the biosoldiers be the only ones looking cool all the time."
26,"Random, reckless attacks are inefficient."
28,"Bring the badly damaged units out of battle! There's more action ahead!"
30,"I'm worried that my arms will get fatter if I keep shooting this gun..."
0,"......"
36,"I'm not letting the Yoju take the airport!"
30,"It wasn't humans who created the Yoju to begin with..."
34,"Isn't the timing too good for them to attack now, when Central Airport is closed?"
29,"We need to deal with the aftermath of "The Third"."
27,"I'll do my best!"
29,"I can't believe these grotesque Yoju could possess human intelligence."
31,"Don't send too many Yoju my way."
0,"..."
37,"If we take too much time here, Sofiapolis risks falling into chaos!"
31,"Why am I fighting? For humankind, is the input I recieved..."
35,"With special ordnance only biosoldiers can wield, don't see us as normal humans!"
30,"There's such a thing as the human will, too..."
28,"I hope this'll be at least a bit useful."
30,"This is taking longer than I expected..."
32,"Between the Yoju and me... which is the stupid one?"
0,"......"
38,"Let's hurry to the next battle!"
0,"......"
36,"Where's our next target?"
31,"I'll fight as many as you want."
29,"Where are the other Yoju?"
31,"How many units are left who are able to continue operations?"
33,"With this we've secured the lobby, right?"
0,"........."
