46,"You've gotten yourself in a bind quickly, Commander... if you blow it here you know heads will roll."
40,"Can't the plane make an emergency landing in a safer place?"
36,"I have a feeling there's some secret involved in this ''countermeasure meeting''..."

41,"Are you nervous?"
0,"..."
48,"Once we've cleaned up here this battle will be over! We should be prepared for a certain amount of damage."

8,"Before we're detected..."
51,"It looks like we made it on time."
0,"......"
