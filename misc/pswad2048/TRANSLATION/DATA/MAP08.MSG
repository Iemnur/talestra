73,"Let's let them know the A.S.S.P. are in Sofiapolis..."
58,"From now on... I won't hand the surface to the likes of the Yoju!"
75,"If they appear before you, just kill them!"
67,"I remember this gymnasium well... Yoju!"
58,"This is the first time in human history that we've had to fight against mutants..."
62,"If you make unnecessary movements, you'll take more fire than otherwise."
61,"Waa... it's big! You could really run around in here..."
11,"The progress of this battle should be being reported to those in the conference room."
74,"I can feel a sort of spirit in the Yoju now that they didn't have before."
59,"I've started to believe that this battle will determine the flow of events from here on."
76,"No need for idle chatter!"
68,"Even my former classmate... You bastards...!"
59,"A ranged unit like me has to be sure of her accuracy..."
63,"It seems the Yoju have finally gotten serious..."
62,"I.. I'll show you my true strength..."
12,"Without fighting spirit, humanity is lost...  the A.S.S.P. is our last hope."
75,"To turn Sofiapolis into their breeding ground... that's the Yoju's goal."
60,"The Yoju's counterattack isn't exactly weak this time..."
77,"If they're going to come, let them. It saves me the time of going to them."
69,"I don't want to defile this place with the blood of the Yoju, but... there's no way they can be forgiven!"
60,"In order to gather the knowledge of people scattered in the various towns, this fight has a meaning, right?"
64,"Is it possible for Yoju to take unified action?"
63,"I'd like to try wearing a school uniform once..."
13,"This armored suit agrees with me..."
76,"It's like the Yoju are being controlled to act as a single unit..."
61,"This fight will be the point where humanity begins to reclaim all it has lost."
78,"Yoju will be the successors of humanity? What foolishness!"
70,"I've never hated Yoju more than I do today!"
61,"Who is MV-11, anyway?"
65,"If we take damage we won't be able to participate in the next battle."
64,"A school, eh......"
14,"If this sense of impending crisis can become a source of pressure on the Factory..."
77,"...For the Yoju, too, this fight is one of life or death."
62,"I can't let my guard drop until this is completely over..."
79,"We finished the battle without breaking up, we can still keep fighting!"
71,"With this we've taken care of quite a lot of these Yoju."
62,"We've disposed of all the Yoju in the gymnasium! Now what?"
66,"We must destroy the Yoju before they grow into even more intolerable beasts."
65,"I like the school! Let's kick all the Yoju's butts!"
0,"........."
