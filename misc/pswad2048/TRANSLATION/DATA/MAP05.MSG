39,"Meeting to plan countermeasures... None of those complicated theories will help anyway."
33,"I'll turn you into the rust on my blade! Not that a high frequency blade can actually rust, of course..."
31,"If we don't eliminate these Yoju, other city representatives won't be able to enter Sofiapolis."
33,"It's dangerous to charge into the midst of the enemy. Let's split their ranks from the start!"
35,"Atchoo!"
0,"..."
42,"We have to maintain our strength until we reclaim the control tower!"
32,"... That's not it..."
40,"I'll scatter you like blowing leaves!"
34,"The Yoju have no chance against us."
32,"They say that neither the A.S.S.P. nor the board of trustees know the exact numbers of the Yoju force."
34,"I want to go all out... but I have to mind the risk, too."
36,"Continued combat operation impossible! Withdrawing from the battlefield!...... Just kidding."

34,"But why...?"
42,"I don't need a reason to kill Yoju!"
36,"I'm not going to pull back!"
34,"In order to retake the control tower we need to conserve our strength here."
36,"We need to teach the Yoju that their makeshift tactics won't do them any good."
38,"Ah! I've been hit.... Just~ ki~dding~."
6,"On the Factory's orders..."
45,"Whew... all that's left is the control tower!"
0,"......"

37,"After liberating the next control vehicle this battle will  be over. Let's work hard through the last stretch."
39,"Whew... take a deep breath."
7,"I am..."
