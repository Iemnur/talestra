22,"These aren't cannon fodder, this is the enemy's main force. Watch out!"
17,"This is the last of them..."
19,"Commander, send me to the heart of battle without reserve! I'll break through their lines!"
17,"... I'll bring it to an end with this."
15,"To use their comrades as bait... Yoju have no value for their comrades' lives."
17,"I want to hope this is the last of them."
19,"I won't forgive a single unfair Yoju!"
0,"...."
23,"If we take the Yoju down thoroughly, bit by bit, our final victory is assured!"
18,"And yet they still remain..."
20,"I'm not going to lose to these bastards!"
18,"It looks like we'll pull through this somehow."
16,"I won't forgive you for treating women that way!"
18,"My bullets will smash your metal shell, and you shall become the prey of my gun."
20,"The hospital smells strange!"
25,"Chi.."
24,"Commander, I expect a full-blown counterattack by the enemy. Please pay attention to the endurance levels of the squad members."
19,"No matter how many we kill, will it do any good?"
21,"To try to trick us like that... They're getting too bold for their own good!"
19,"This lot is different from the ones we fought before."
17,"Just how intelligent are these Yoju? To think of using diversionary tactics..."
19,"There's no doubt that this is the main force of the enemy. Their response to our attacks is different from before!"
21,"Looking at these guys makes me want to eat spaghetti..."
0,"......"
25,"I'm going to annihilate the Yoju in one fell swoop!"
20,"One final attack and it's over."
22,"The tide has turned to our advantage."
20,"Victory is in sight! Let's put it all into this last spurt!"
18,"By using decoy forces they scattered and weakened their strength. At this rate I think we have them beaten."
20,"Just a little while until we recapture the hospital..."
22,"I'm not an idiot!"
26,"Ch..."
26,"This time it's over for sure."
21,"Whew..."
23,"That's your punishment for underestimating the A.S.S.P.."
21,"I can finally drink some hot coffee..."
19,"We won, but at the cost of unnecessary civilian casualties..."
21,"Whew... I was worried for awhile in there."
23,"It's over, it's over!"
0,"......"
