66,"The enemy should be desperate at this point... We can't afford to be unprepared."
50,"I'll determine my own fate! The first step is rooting out these Yoju."
69,"We can't allow these man-eating Yoju to multiply any further!"
59,"Terrible! To do such a thing to my school..."
52,"We either split them and avoid a mass attack, or herd them together and finish them off."
56,"For the school to be attacked... Sofiapolis is no longer safe either."
55,"Oh, so this is a school? It's way different from our training grounds."
0,"..."
67,"It's dangerous to just charge into their ranks!"
51,"I'll stop complaining!"
70,"Saeko must be terribly frustrated..."
60,"Let me kill them!"
53,"Yoju will not inherit the Earth!"
57,"As long as we're here, humanity will survive!"
56,"It says here that we should be quiet in the classroom... do you think they'll get mad if we fire our guns?"
0,"......"
68,"Humans aren't cattle for the Yoju!"
52,"I'm not fighting Yoju because I was programmed or ordered to - it's because I have the power to!"
71,"I can't stand the thought of the surface being covered by these wriggling beasts!"
61,"I can't just stand still while they trample my memories underfoot!"
54,"It's true that humans polluted the world, but if we defeat the Yoju we can heal it."
58,"Despicable creatures... your birth was a mistake!"
57,"Sheesh... with the Yoju flailing about like this cleaning up after them will be a mess..."
0,"..."
69,"I'll show you that Biosoldiers weren't created without a reason."
53,"I won't lose... I don't want to lose!"
72,"The battle has just begun, try not to take any unnecessary damage!"
62,"I'll slice you into a hundred pieces!"
55,"We can see their attack on the academy as an extention of the Yoju's brute force tactics."
59,"As expected, the Yoju have reached their moment of desperation..."
58,"Poor Saeko-chan..."
0,"......"
70,"With this all the Yoju here have been taken care of!"
54,"It's still not over yet."
73,"It's only just begun...!"
63,"Ku...!"
56,"Traces of the Yoju's presence still remain..."
60,"How are our losses here?"
59,"Let's rest for just a bit."
0,"........."
