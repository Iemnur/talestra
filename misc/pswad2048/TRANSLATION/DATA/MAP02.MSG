15,"If it comes down to a melee we'll be at a disadvantage numerically."
10,"Things look pretty bad on this floor too."
12,"I'll pay the Yoju back for the pain and suffering they've caused the people!"
10,"When I'm in this place, it reminds me of the time I was rescued..."
10,"I can't believe the extent of the damage the Yoju have caused..."
10,"Minced Yoju garnished with lead slugs... Geh... I shouldn't have said that."
13,"And thus, the fight continues..."
0,"..."
14,"Even if they were born from the body of a human mother, their shapes are those of demons. I won't hold back."
11,"The Yoju's activity has become more violent!"
13,"If you're not going to come at me full throttle, I'm coming for you!"
11,"I can sense that we're all stuck in the foul spirits these Yoma are exhuding..."
11,"We can't let them claim any more victims!"
11,"If the operation begins in a disciplined manner we won't have any problems."

13,"If it weren't for the Yoju I would have been born and lived as a normal girl..."
15,"The second floor Yoju don't amount to much either... It's hard to think this could be a trap."
13,"A regular blade would be destroyed by now."
13,"I'm trying my best not to be a burden..."
13,"We've come this far, looks like there aren't any tricks up their sleeves!"

18,"It looks like we're all finished."
14,"I wanna go home..."
16,"This deployment of the A.S.S.P. wasn't more than a preliminary trial."
14,"So it's over with this?"

14,"So this is the end, not an easy victory..."
