79,"I can't believe they managed to penetrate this far..."
64,"With this mission the campaign will be over, right..."
82,"There's no need to hold back. Even if one more attack's worth of damage gets through, it's worth it."
73,"I won't let you turn my friends into tools for birthing new Yoju!"
64,"We can win! We've won up to this point, haven't we!"
69,"You've got bad luck, Commander. Since you started here it's been nothing but big battles..."
67,"To attack the girl's dormitory, these Yoju are perverted!"
17,"The Factory is hiding the truth about the Yoju! If our actual results were made known..."
80,"If we can free this place, our battles will be over. Do your best..."
65,"I'll fight to the bitter end... It's a battle that has meaning for me, after all..."
83,"It's as tough as expected, but... one last effort..."
74,"I'll take revenge for my friends!"
65,"For the Yoju, little more than relics from the last war, to take humanity's place... No way."
70,"There's a biosoldier inside MV-11, right? She could at least go by her actual name."
68,"No one is going to want to live in a dormitory that the Yoju have entered."
18,"We can't let the Yoju escape from within the sphere of our attack."
81,"We'll certify here that Sofiapolis is proof against all invasion!"
66,"I can't believe they've attacked the school... the victims are girls who can't even fight back."
84,"The Yoju that invaded Sofiapolis aren't going to live to return from whence they came!"
75,"I used to pass through here to get to the school building! I can't believe it's come to this!"
66,"I thought the strength of biosoldiers was our abandonment of emotion, but it seems I was mistaken."
71,"For a species trying to inherit the earth to lay waste to a school..."
69,"It says no boys allowed... That means you too, Commander."
19,"I'm looking forward to identifying myself when I recieve my official assignment to join your ranks."
82,"Since we've come this far... as long as one person survives, we can afford to go all out with the power we've got left!"
67,"Just a bit... Just a bit more until it's over."
85,"The Yoju's numbers have decreased, but our strength is depleted as well."
76,"Ku...!"
67,"If you have any brains, I'll teach you that an invasion of Sofiapolis is futile!"
72,"It's the last stage. Time to go all out on you guys."
70,"Having not failed even on this big a mission - I just might be fabulous."
20,"When this battle is over..."
83,"It was a tough fight..."
68,"We did it. All of the Yoju have been processed..."
86,"It's over. Fufu.... We won."
77,"My determination to fight the Yoju has strengthened once again."
68,"Somehow... We did it until the end..."
73,"A long day for the A.S.S.P. indeed."
71,"Next time... I want to come when there aren't any Yoju in the school."
21,"I wonder what's happening with the conference...?"
